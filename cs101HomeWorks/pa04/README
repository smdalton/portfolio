ABOUT greedy.c:

USAGE: <flag: -D or -P > <start vertex> <input file>

        greedy.c When executed will perform a rudimentary analysis on the input graph file in an adjacency list representation. Depending on input flags either(-P for Prim’s MST algorithm) or (-D for Dijkstra’s SSP algorithm). Arrays will be presented showing the values of each vertex’s parent in the tree/path as well as the weight at each edge from source to destination.
